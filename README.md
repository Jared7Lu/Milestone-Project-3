    The inspiration for this project was to deepen my understanding of the different technologies I learned in bootcamp and build a project that is functional. I also wanted to find through this which areas I need to work on and what I feel comfortable doing. 

    //How to use App
    1. Make and account 
    2. Verify email address
    3. Create your own Post 
    4. Start sharing Products

    //Technologies 
    React, Supabase, Vercel 

    //Bugs
    I have one functional problem which is that anyone can edit any comment. I need to edit the database in order for it to save in a different way besides getting it through a token. 

    The second problem is that my home page is not responsive, somewhere along the styling of it, it unfortunatly broke.
